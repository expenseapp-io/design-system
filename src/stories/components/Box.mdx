# Box

Box component could be used for message with no data

<UnstyledWithTheme>
  <div className="box">
    <span>You don't have anything yet</span>
  </div>
</UnstyledWithTheme>

As well as some kind of box for spinner

<UnstyledWithTheme>
  <div className="box">
    <div className="spinner" />
  </div>
</UnstyledWithTheme>

We could also add any element we want, to make it a more complex

<UnstyledWithTheme>
  <div className="box" style={{ gap: 16 }}>
    <span>You don't have an account?</span>
    <button type="button" className="button">Register</button>
  </div>
</UnstyledWithTheme>
